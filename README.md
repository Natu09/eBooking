# Database Management system for eBooking Application

## Problem Statement 

For the longest time and even now, most clinics use receptionist to book appointments for patients, rebook appointments, remind patients of their appointments, and cancel appointments. This process of booking an appointment for a patient causes No-shows, longer wait times due to high call volumes, or cancelled appointments, which are costly and unfortunately a reality for many healthcare providers in Canada.  In 2014, 90% of surveyed Canadians expressed a desire for online appointment booking, yet only 7% of Canadian family physicians offered it. This falls far below the 66% of Swedish physicians and 30% of American physicians who offer online appointment requests (2012).
